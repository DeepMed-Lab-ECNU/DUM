# Debiasing Medical Knowledge for Prompting Universal Model in CT Image Segmentation

A PyTorch implementation of **DUM**, a causal debiasing framework that enhances generalization in universal medical image segmentation by mitigating knowledge bias from text prompts. DUM leverages both organ-level semantic priors and instance-level visual context to improve robustness across diverse clinical scenarios. Based on the paper: [*Debiasing Medical Knowledge for Prompting Universal Model in CT Image Segmentation*](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/11080474/).
